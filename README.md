learn-specter
=============

An interactive tutorial to the [Specter] [1] library. Work in progress!

## Development 

For compiling learn-specter the following is needed:

* [Boot] [2] 
* [sassc] [3], version 3.2.5 or greater. `brew install sassc` should do it on OS X.
* [bower] [4], for retrieving some frontend dependencies like Bootstrap.

With everything installed, you can run `boot dev` to launch a REPL and start auto-compiling ClojureScript. 
For the browser REPL, run `(start-repl)` and point your browser at http://localhost:3000.
